                    <h2>Let's not waste time. DON'T sign up for this course if ...</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>You haven't started or are not about to start a business.  Come back later. </li>
                    <li>You have &gt;100 paying customers and know how to get more.</li>
                    <li>You think Gary Vaynerchuk is an idiot - our strategy is based on what made Gary successful.</li>
                    </ul><p>But most importantly â€¦ do not sign up for this course if you won't get on a call and help someone for 30 minutes - with no expectation of getting anything more than an opportunity to learn about their problems and win their trust. </p><p>Seriously - save the spot for somebody else. </p>
                    <h2>So who is this for?</h2>
                    <p>If you're a founder who's ever thought...</p><ul>
                    <li>I'm following the strategies like Lean Startup - and I'm still not getting initial customers.</li>
                    <li>I'm tired of building products that don't sell.</li>
                    <li>How can I get above the noise? Get traction for my idea?</li>
                    <li>I'm tired of being a wannapreneur - I'm ready to work hard at something new.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>If that sounds like you, then this is for you.</h2>

                    <h1>What you can expect from the course</h1>

                    <h2>I'm going to tell you to stop listening to the "marketing pros"</h2>
                    <p>For the past 2 years I've been helping entrepreneurs get their first 100 customers by making them do something different. But first I'm going to ask you to STOP trying to do what the "marketing pros" are telling you to do.  Stop growth hacking, stop looking at metrics, stop content marketing.  </p><p>"Growth hacking" isn't going to get you your first 100 customers.  Nor will Google Analytics.  Or SEM, SEO, SMM, or even SMX.</p><p>Yep, not even SMX.  </p><p>You haven't heard of SMX????? It's the latest cool marketing hack - Techcrunch did an article about it.  </p><p>Ok, I just made up SMX. I'm also going to tell you to stop reading Techcrunch or the rest of the startup entertainment industry.  It's all crap that won't help you get your first 100 customers.</p>
                    <h2>I'm going to ask you do focus ruthlessly on 1 thing - being helpful</h2>
                    <p>I'm going ask you to get your first 100 customers by helping people 1:1.  </p><p>Your customers are not a subscriber, metric, click, visitor, or a Follower.  They are people.  People with problems - and the fastest way you're going to figure out what they need and get 100 of them to buy a solution is to start helping them.  </p><p><strong>This is a critical point - so I'll repeat it</strong></p><p>I want you to STOP trying to get them to notice you and START doing anything you can do to help them.  </p><p>They key to getting your first 100 customers is proving to them that you are more committed to helping them than anyone else on the planet.  More committed than companies with better products and more money than you.</p><p>Start helping people 1:1 and â€¦</p><ul>
                    <li>Customer Development challenges will be easy because they will be bringing their problems to you.</li>
                    <li>They will buy from you - even when your product isn't very good.</li>
                    <li>You will have a small army of fans who give you testimonials, refer people to you, and do pretty much anything to help you succeed.<br>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>This isn't an automated email course</h2>
                    <p>I'm not going to dump you into a Google group and ask you to post your homework - I'm going ask you to send it to us so we can read it and get back to you.  I'm going to ask you to schedule a call with us or others on SoHelpful.  </p>
                    <h2>Getting your first 100 customer will be easier - and harder - than you expect</h2>
                    <p>You probably think you know how this will work - but you're almost certainly wrong.  I know because I've been teaching this for 2 years with failures and successes.  </p><p>You probably don't feel like you know enough, imagine it takes too much time, or don't know who you would help.  You're wrong - these will NOT be your challenges.</p><p>What will be a challenge is convincing people to call you - but fortunately I can show you how.  And that is why I won't let you sign up for SoHelpful unless you take this course.  </p>
                    <h2>You might decide to use our strategy and not use SoHelpful - that's ok with us</h2>
                    <p>Don't get me wrong - I am absolutely going to suggest that you sign up for SoHelpful during this course because I built it specifically to get you your first 100 customers.  But ultimately you know best and may decide that it isn't for you.</p><p>We both win either way.</p><p>By helping you implement this strategy I get an opportunity to learn about you, your business, challenges - this type of insight is incredibly valuable to me.</p><p>And hopefully you'll win by learning a new way to get your first 100 customers based on a proven technique that doesn't rely on marketing buzzword bingo.</p>
