                  <h2>Be honest with yourself: are you on the path to success?</h2>
                  <p>I've spent the last 10 years helping people like you get their businesses going. I've seen a few spectacular successes and failures - but mostly smart, passionate people struggling to achieve their dreams.  Whenever I see great people struggling I do what I can to help them - and that usually starts with an honest assessment about (1) where they are, and (2) why they are not where they expected to be.</p>

                  <p>And so I’m going to ask you to do the same:</p>

                  <p>What were your dreams and expectations when you started?  Are you on the path to success?  Why not?</p>

                  <p>Let’s be frank - you wouldn’t be reading this if you were achieving the success we both know you are capable of.  So let’s put the b.s. aside and be brutally honest with each other: something isn’t working.</p>
                  <br>

                  <p>(btw, it has taken me longer to learn how to grow a business than anyone I know - trust me, I know how you feel right now, but I promise you that recognizing the problem is the first step to success)</p>

                  <h2>I'm 99% sure I know WHY you're not as successful as you should be.</h2>

                  <p>Ok, so not everything is going as we hoped. Why?  Maybe you're not getting enough customer leads. Or customers are not interested in your product. Perhaps you can't get them to find - much less read - your blog. Maybe you can't seen to push interested customers into buying. </p>
                  <p>Heck, maybe you just want to be an entrepreneur and don't know how to escape the day job.</p>

                  <p>Once I get people to tell me what they think their biggest problem is ... I start asking WHY?  WHY isn't your book selling?  WHY don't you know?  WHY haven't you just asked 50 of them?</p>

                  <p>So now ask yourself these tough questions:  why, Why, WHY, WHY!!!!!!!</p>

                  <p><strong>The root cause is almost always the same - your relationships (or lack of them) with your customers.</strong></p>

                  <p>Don't believe me?  Then ask yourself how different your life would be if you knew hundreds of them - and thousands more knew of you and thought you were absolutely amazing.  If they trusted you so much that they called you and told you their problems ... and even offered to pay you to solve them.</p>

                  <p>(yes, I've taught people how to do this.)</p>

                  <h2>So why aren't you doing the 1 thing guaranteed to help you meet more customers &amp; earn their respect?</h2>

                  <p>Ok, so now we know the source of your challenges: customers.  So what are you going to do about it?</p>

                  <p>I have a suggestion - 1 very specific thing you can do that will dramatically change the course of your business. The 1 thing you can do to separate you from the 95% who will continue to struggle for years.</p>
                  <p>And it isn’t<br>
                    ... great ideas, <br>
                    ...... beautiful products,<br>
                    ......... expertise,<br>
                    ............ or lots of money.</p>

                  <p>These things just don’t matter anymore because our customers are constantly bombarded by companies claiming to have them.</p>

                  <p>So what is that 1 thing? The 1 thing you can do differently that guarantees you success?</p>

                  <p><strong>BE MORE HELPFUL THAN ANYONE ELSE</strong></p>

                  <p>It really, really is just that simple. If you decided - right now - that your are going to be better at helping customers than anyone else you are giving yourself 1,000,000x better odds of succeeding.</p>

                  <p>It works for Gary Vaynerchuk. It works for me. It works for dozens of us on SoHelpful. And, yes, being helpful can work for you.</p>

                  <div id="gary">
                    <span id="gary-pic"><img class="responsive-image"  src="img/gary_v.jpg"></span>
                    <span id="gary-quote">“I attract a crowd, not because I’m an extrovert or I’m over the top or I’m oozing with charisma. It’s because I care.”<br>
                      --Gary Vaynerchuk</span>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                  </div>

                  <h2 id="beinghelpfulistheunlikelysecrettoyoursuccess">Being helpful is the unlikely secret to your success</h2>

                  <p>We live a world more obsessed with tech, data and scale than people. Companies build beautiful gizmos for practically nothing and then shovel them at us through email, Facebook ads, email, commercials, email - and, yes, even more email.</p>

                  <p>So what can you do to be different? Do what Gary Vaynerchuk does - prove you’re worth it by being helpful. It is the one thing - really the only thing - you can do that is uniquely you. </p>
                  <h2 id="iofferyouachoice">How badly do you want it? Are you ready to try something new?</h2>

                  <p>And now you have a choice to make.</p>

                  <p>You can … </p>

                  <p>… continue doing what everyone else is doing: write more blog posts, send more email, cold-contact people on LinkedIn, get more followers &amp; friends. And most likely you’ll find yourself in a similar position 6 months from now. </p>

                  <p>-OR-</p>

                  <p>... start doing the 1 thing that matters: become more helpful than anyone else.</p>

                  <p>You can <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/users/sign_up?plan=sohelpful9">try SoHelpful for absolutely no risk </a>- what in the world do you have to lose?</p>


                  <h1 id="page-faq">Answers to your questions</h1>

                  <h2 id="idontfeellikeanexpert.canireallyhelppeoplethroughsohelpful">I don’t feel like an expert. Can I really help people through SoHelpful?</h2>

                  <p>Yes, yes, YES! Every one of us worries about this at first - I know I did. “What if somebody asks me a question and I don’t know the answer?”</p>

                  <p>Here is the reality - the “answer” doesn’t matter. That’s why people who are beginners are often more successful on SoHelpful than so-called “experts”. So what does matter?</p>

                  <p>Listening.<br>
                  Offering suggestion.<br>
                  Helping people consider their options.
                  </p>

                  <p>People who ask for help don’t care how much you know - they care about THEIR problems, themselves. What matters is how much you genuinely care about helping them.</p>

                  <h2 id="wonthelpingpeopleforfreecheapenthevalueofmypaidwork">Won’t helping people “for free” cheapen the value of my paid work?</h2>

                  <p>No. Don’t ever work for free. I sure don’t. </p>

                  <p>Think of SoHelpful calls as a marketing opportunity: a chance to build your reputation, prove your expertise, or build trust as part of your sales funnel by being helpful. Along with writing, speaking, going to Meetups, etc. SoHelpful is just another way to do it. </p>

                  <p>Remember, money is just one form of currency - the people you help will also “pay” you by giving you insight into their challenges, offering ideas for blog posts, and giving you testimonials. </p>

                  <h2 id="wontsohelpfulrequirealotofextrawork">Won’t SoHelpful require a lot of extra work?</h2>

                  <p>No. SoHelpful is most effective if you integrate your offer to be helpful as part of your existing marketing efforts. You’ll find scheduled, 30-minute calls helping someone to be a fun break in your daily routine. </p>

                  <h2 id="howdoesthisscale">How does this scale?</h2>

                  <p>Help the people who are most important to growing your business - that’s how SoHelpful scales. When you’re just starting that might be “anyone who needs it”. As your business grows that might be “existing customers” or “qualified leads”.</p>

                  <p>Do this and you’ll get massive value from every conversation.</p>

                  <h2 id="howissohelpfuldifferentthantimetradescheduleonce">How is SoHelpful different than Timetrade, ScheduleOnce … ?</h2>

                  <p>SoHelpful isn’t a general appointment application. SoHelpful’s scheduler is easy to use because does 1 thing well: allows someone to book a 30-minute Hangout, Skype or phone call at times convenient to you. (Some Americans call this an “office hours” system.)</p>

                  <p>I decided to start building SoHelpful because general appointment tools didn’t work well for this purpose. Most of our customers report the same.</p>

                  <h2 id="howissohelpfuldifferentthanexpertnetworkslikegooglehelpoutsglgclarity">How is SoHelpful different than “expert networks” like Google Helpouts, GLG, Clarity…?</h2>

                  <p>People who provide help on &#8220;expert&#8221; networks charge for their time. It makes perfect sense for a lawyer or management consultant to charge by the minute - their time IS their product.</p>

                  <p>The people on SoHelpful help others for a different business goal - to build their reputations, get insight, or close sales, for instance.</p>

                  <h2 id="whyisthemostcommonreasonsohelpfuldoesntworkforpeople">Why is the most common reason SoHelpful DOESN’T work for people?</h2>

                  <p>SoHelpful alone won’t instantly make you popular and grow your business. If that’s your expectation, don’t sign up for it. </p>

                  <p>Yes, you will get exposure from SoHelpful - through search engines, new relationships with others on SoHelpful, and through our searchable directory (coming soon).</p>

                  <p>People don't magicall love you when you sign up for Wordpress - SoHelpful is no different.</p>
