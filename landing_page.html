He gave sound advice, both in broad strokes and specifics. Before speaking with Kevin I was at a crossroads, his insights cleared a few things up for me. A seriously great guy and certainly someone I'll continue to vet ideas with.</p>

                        <p>Hi, I'm Kevin Dewalt, founder of SoHelpful &amp; creator of the Helpful Marketing&trade; strategy.</p>
                        <p>Questions? Just contact me at <a href="mailto:kevindewalt@kevindewalt.com?subject=Question about SoHelpful">kevindewalt@kevindewalt.com</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kevindewalt" target="_blank">@kevindewalt</a>, or schedule a call with me at <a href="http://sohelpful.me/kevindewalt">sohelpful.me/kevindewalt</a>.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I'm going to share my story with you. <strong>Here's why I built SoHelpful - and how helping others will transform your business</strong>.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Like most entrepreneurs - I didn't know enough potential customers</h2>

                        <p>In 2012 I was at a frustrating point in my career. I had moved to Beijing, China where I had few professional contacts. My blog and social media presence were dormant and I was having a difficult time getting anyone to read what I wrote. <strong>I wanted to build products but I wasn&rsquo;t meeting enough customers</strong>.</p>

                        <p>I tried the usual tricks &ndash; blogging, social media, going to events, emailing people, coffee meetings. Although I had tons of experience, I had a problem: almost all of my professional relationships were in Washington, DC &ndash; home for the previous 15 years.</p>

                        <p>And here I was &hellip; in China! How could I do Customer Development to learn customer problems if 95% of my relationships are 12 time zones and 6,000 miles away?</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>How did I meet more customers?  By helping them over Skype</h2>


                        <p>To get above the noise I decided to try something desperate: <strong>I made myself available to help any entrepreneur&nbsp;in the world for 30 minutes over Skype</strong>. By &quot;any&quot;, I mean I opened my calendar with times ANYONE could book.</p>


                        <p>It worked!</p>

                        <p>Before long I was helping entrepreneurs around the world over Skype - America, Spain, Israel, Singapore, Africa, Iran - EVERYWHERE. The people I helped appreciated my generosity, left me recommendations, and started telling others about me. You can <a href="http://sohelpful.me/kevindewalt" target="_blank">see these amazing people here</a>.</p>

                        <p>My blog subscribers and Twitter followers began growing as word started to spread. <strong>My audience rapidly grew when I wrote about solutions to the problems entrepreneurs asked me</strong>. Their problems inspired new product ideas. I started getting invitations to mentor at startup accelerators and speak at prestigious events like Eric Ries&#39;s Lean Startup Conference.</p>

                        <p><strong>And...yes...the people I helped turned into paying customers.</strong></p>

                        <p>But most of all I was enjoying the satisfaction of helping other people and seeing how it boosted my reputation. People I never met would approach me and say, &ldquo;I saw that you help entrepreneurs worldwide &ndash; that is so awesome of you! Someday I&rsquo;ll come and ask you for help.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Did it take work? Of course!</p>

                        <p>But it was actually <strong>saving me time!</strong> For my entire career I had been &ldquo;networking&rdquo; by meeting people at events, conferences, coffee/lunch meetings, etc. Those &ldquo;coffee meetings&rdquo; take 5 emails to schedule and 3 hours of your day. Helping people over Skype is way, way more efficient.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>But I needed a better system to manage everything - so I created SoHelpful</h2>

                        <p>I started building a product to help me meet more potential customers, save administrative time, and create more value from the discussions - hence the list of SoHelpful features you see above.</p>

                        <p>But it gets even better...</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>What started as a tool is growing into a network of helpful professionals</h2>

                        <p>Soon other professionals began using SoHelpful and having a similar experience to mine.</p>

                        <p>... <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/justin" target="_blank">Justin Wilcox</a> is building a worldwide reputation as a startup mentor...</p>

                        <p>... <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/brucemccarthy" target="_blank">Bruce McCarthy</a> is meeting more product managers and building evangelists for his product management product, Reqqs...</p>

                        <p>... <a href="https://www.sohelpful.me/jake" target="_blank">Jake Peterson</a> is getting more paying clients for his Analytics service...</p>

                        <p>We now use SoHelpful to make referrals to each other - a win-win-win for everyone.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>If you want to build your business, reputation, and meet more potential customers by helping them 1-1 via Skype, Hangout or phone calls, then SoHelpful is for you</strong>.</p>


                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Are you a freelancer or service provider?</h2>

                        <p>SoHelpful will help you form closer relationships with more potential customers worldwide.  Instead of "coffee meetings" - which take hours to setup and attend - you'll be able <strong>build your sales pipeline by helping people on Skype or Hangout</strong>.  Some will become paying clients - others will give you great testimonials and tell friends about you.</p>


                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Are you a startup or product entrepreneur?</h2>

                         <p>Just imagine how much easier Customer Development would be <strong>if customers called you and told you their problems</strong>.  When you help them 1-1 that is exactly what happens - you'll not only build a great reputation ... but you'll also know what solutions to build. The people you help will buy your products because they trust you.  The testimonials they give you will help you sell.</p>

                         <p>&nbsp;</p>
                         <h2>Are you an author, blogger or someone who sells content?</h2>
                         <p>I bet you would like to know what your audience wants to read - before you write anything.  <strong>SoHelpful will help you connect with your audience</strong>.  Answers to the questions they ask will tell you what your audience wants to hear.  It turns out that thousands of others will have the same questions - questions your can answer in your content.</p>
